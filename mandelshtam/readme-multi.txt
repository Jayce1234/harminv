Steven,

I will send you reply to your message soon.  I just decided to send
you our multi-window-multiscale-basis program as well. You are free to
use it.  It was actually implemented as a plug-in into NMRpipe - NMR
software package.

The driving routine is fdm1d_multiwindow.f

test.f shows how to use it.

There are a lot of comments inside the codes made by my student
Jianhan Chen, who actually wrote most of the code.

Vladimir.
