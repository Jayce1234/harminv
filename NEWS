Harminv 1.2.1:

 * Impose a maximum number of basis modes (300) to prevent the matrices
   from getting too large.

 * Corrected typo in man page (for definition of -d density).

Harminv 1.2:

 * Command line tool now defaults to a particular spectral "density"
   (set by the -d option), rather than a number of basis modes,
   since using too many basis modes leads to a singular eigenproblem
   and numerical instability.  (Based on defaults from M&T references.)

 * Use long double precision, if available, to reduce accumulation
   of floating-point errors while computing Fourier/Z transforms.

Harminv 1.1:

 * Corrected bug in frequency-error calculation; thanks to V. A.
   Mandelshtam for helpful discussions and for letting me look
   at his code to check against mine.

 * Amplitude calculation is no longer unstable for strongly decaying modes.

 * Used a more accurate eigensolver routine.

 * Added -e/-E/-a/-A/-Q options to screen outputs with
   error/amplitude/Q too large/small/small, respectively.

 * Added -w option to use angular frequency instead of frequency.

 * More flexible input format: allow comma-delimited, a-bi as well as a+bi.

 * API cleanups.

Harminv 1.0.2:

 * Corrected inadvertent windowing of data that degraded accuracy
   in the case of very short signals.

Harminv 1.0.1:

 * Corrected some minor release glitches.

Harminv 1.0:

 * Initial release (after 4 years of private use).
